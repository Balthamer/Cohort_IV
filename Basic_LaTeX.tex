\section{The very basics}

This is some text!
This text is on the same line as the first.

This is a new paragraph. You can do bold, italic and underline in LaTeX. \textbf{This is bold.} \textit{This is italic.} \underline{This is underlined.} \textbf{\textit{\underline{This is all three at once.}}} If you want to do a quote, you can use two tic marks to open the quote. ``This is a quote."
